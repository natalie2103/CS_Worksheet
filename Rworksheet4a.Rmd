## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1a. Describe the data.
    
#a
  shoeSize_height_data <- data.frame(
 
  shoe_Size = c (6.5,9.0,8.5,8.5,10.5,7.0,9.5,9.0,13.0,7.5,10.5,8.5,12.0,10.5,13.0,11.5,8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0),
 
  height = c (66.0,68.0,64.5,65.0,70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0),
 
  Gender = c ('F','F','F','F','M','F','F','F','M','F','M','F','M','M','M','M','F','F','M','F','F','M','M','F','M','M','M','M')
)

#a
  summary(shoeSize_height_data)

#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.
   male_subset <- subset(shoeSize_height_data, gender =="M",select = c(shoe_Size,height))
 
   female_subset <- subset(shoeSize_height_data,gender =="F",select = c(shoe_Size,height))
   
   print(male_subset)
   print(female_subset)

#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
  mean_shoeSize <- mean(shoeSize_height_data$shoe_Size)
  mean_height <- mean(shoeSize_height_data$height)

  
  cat(mean_shoeSize)
  cat(mean_height)
  
#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and ..height? Why?
  Yes, there is a relationship between shoe size and height because shoe size is generally propotional to height.

#Factors.....
  Gender <- c('M','F','F','M')
  factor_Gender <- factor(Gender)
  factor_Gender
  
#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
  Months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February",
April")
  factor_Months <- factor(Months)
  factor_Months

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. Interpret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
  summary(factor_Months)
#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
  Direction <- c("East","West","North")
  Direction
  Frequency <- c(1,4,3)
  Frequency
  
  factor_Direction <- factor(Direction)
  factor_Direction
  
  new_order_data <- factor(factor_Direction,levels = c("East","West","North"))
  print(new_order_data)
  
#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv


#a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function. Write the code.

#b. View the dataset. Write the R scripts and its result.
