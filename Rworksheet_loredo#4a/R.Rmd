## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.
    male_subset <- subset(shoeSize_height)

#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
    MeanNumSize <- mean(Shoesizeand$Height)
    IsMean5 <- MeanNumSize == 5
    print(IsMean5)
#d

#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
  Months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February",|
April")
  factor_months_vector <- factor(Months)
  factor_months_vector
